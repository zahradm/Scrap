The spray will only work properly if you hold the can with the dome pointing straight down.,Either stand with one leg raised on a chair, or lie down on your side with your lower leg stretched out and upper leg bent.,Gently put the tip of the applicator into your anus as far as possible. You may want to use a lubricating jelly on the tip of the applicator.,Push the dome down. This fills the applicator with a dose of foam.,Release the dome very slowly, to push the foam out.,Wait 10 to 15 seconds and then slowly remove the applicator from your bottom.

It's difficult to tell how much is left in a bottle and it's important to not run out.,How to apply a GTN patch,Sit down.,Decide where to put your patch – choose an area of skin with no hair, or very little hair, so the patch sticks well. Good places are the side of your chest, upper arm, shoulder or thigh.

In this case, just skip the missed patch and apply the next one at the usual time.,If you miss a dose of your daily ,ointment,, use it as soon as possible, unless it's nearly time for your next dose. In this case, just leave out the missed dose and apply the next one as usual.,Never use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.,If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm or reminder to help you remember.

If you take too many tablets, remove any tablets that are left undissolved in your mouth. If you use too much ointment, wash it off.

For a full list see the leaflet inside your medicines packet.,What to do about:,headaches, – make sure you rest and drink plenty of fluids. Ask a pharmacist to recommend a painkiller for headaches. Paracetamol is safe to take with GTN. Try to avoid alcohol, as it could make your headaches worse. Headaches usually go away after a few days if you use GTN regularly. Talk to your doctor if they last longer than a week or are severe. If using GTN ointment, reduce your ointment by 1cm if you are trying to find the right dose.,feeling dizzy, weak, tired or sleepy, – stop what you are doing and sit or lie down until you feel better. Avoid alcohol, as it could make you feel worse. Do not drive, ride a bike or use tools or machinery until you feel better.,feeling sick, – this usually goes away on its own, but it might help to take sips of a cold drink (fizzy drinks help some people), or peppermint tea. This will also stop you getting dehydrated. Avoid rich, greasy or spicy foods, as these could make you feel worse. Stick to small, simple snacks or meals if you are hungry.,red face (flushing), – try to cut down on coffee, tea and alcohol because they can make flushing worse. It might help to keep the room cool and use a fan. You could also spray your face with cool water or sip cold or iced drinks.

Breastfeeding will also benefit both you and your baby.,If you do breastfeed while taking GTN, look out for the side effects in your baby. If you notice that your baby is not feeding as well as usual, or seems unusually sleepy, or if you have any other concerns about your baby, talk to your health visitor or doctor.,Some medicines can interfere with the way GTN works.,If you take other medicines that lower blood pressure with GTN, it can sometimes lower your blood pressure too much.

This is because a dry mouth can reduce how well GTN tablets work, so GTN spray may be better for you.,Taking GTN with painkillers,Paracetamol, is safe to take with GTN.,Do not take ,non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs), regularly, such as ,ibuprofen,, ,aspirin, and ,naproxen,. These may make your angina worse.,Talk to your pharmacist if you need a painkiller stronger than paracetamol."

",https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/glimepiride/,"Glimepiride is a medicine used to treat ,type 2 diabetes,. ,
,Type 2 diabetes is a condition where the body doesn't make enough 
insulin, or the insulin that it makes doesn't work properly. This can 
cause high blood sugar levels (,hyperglycaemia,).,
,Glimepiride lowers your blood sugar by increasing the amount of insulin your body produces.,
,Glimepiride is only available on prescription. It comes as tablets.,
,
,It's usual to take glimepiride once a day in the morning.,
,The most common side effects are feeling sick, indigestion and diarrhoea.,

,Some people find they put on weight with glimepiride.,
,Glimepiride is also known by the brand name Amaryl.,
,
,Glimepiride can be taken by adults (aged 18 years and older). ,
,A diabetes specialist may sometimes prescribe glimepiride for children and young people less than 18 years of age. ,

,Doses of glimepiride can vary. Follow your doctor's instructions when taking this medicine.,
,You'll usually take glimepiride once a day. Take this medicine with food.,
,Most people take it in the morning with their breakfast. If you don't eat breakfast, make sure you take it with your first meal of the day. Try to take it at the same time every day. ,
,Swallow the tablets whole, with a glass or water. Do not chew them. ,
,If you find it difficult to swallow tablets, use the score line in the middle of the tablet to break it in 2, then take both halves. ,
,How much will I take?,
,Glimepiride comes as 1mg, 2mg, 3mg and 4mg tablets. ,
,Your doctor will tell you how many tablets to take. You may need to take 1 or 2 tablets to make up your daily dose. ,
,The usual starting dose for adults is 1mg, taken once a day. Your doctor may increase your dose gradually over a few weeks or months, up to a regular dose of 4mg once a day. ,
,The maximum daily dose is 6mg. ,
,Will my dose go up or down?,
,Your doctor will check your blood sugar levels regularly. They may change your dose of glimepiride to keep your blood sugar under control.,
,What if I take too much?,
,The amount of glimepiride that can lead to an overdose varies from person to person.,
,If you think you have ,low blood sugar,, have some food or drink that quickly gets sugar into your bloodstream such as sugar cubes or fruit juice. ,
,This type of sugar won't last long in your blood. You may also need to eat a starchy carbohydrate, like a sandwich or a couple of biscuits.,
,What if I forget to take it?,
,If you forget to take your daily glimepiride, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time. ,
,Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten one.,
,If you forget doses often, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to remember your medicines.,
,Like all medicines, glimepiride can cause side effects although not everyone gets them. ,
,Common side effects,
,These common side effects happen in more than 1 in 100 people. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if these side effects bother you or don't go away:,

,
,Your eyesight may also be affected for a short time. This often happens when you start your treatment because of changes in your blood sugar levels.,
,Serious side effects,

,Call your doctor straight away if:,
,
,your skin or the whites of your eyes turn yellow - these can be signs of a liver problem,

,
,feeling hungry,
,trembling or shaking,
,sweating,
,confusion,
,difficulty concentrating,
,

,To prevent hypos, it's important to have regular meals, including breakfast. Never miss or delay a meal.,
,If you're planning to exercise more than usual, make sure you eat carbohydrates (bread, pasta, cereals) before, during or afterwards.,
,Always carry a fast-acting carbohydrate with you, like sugar cubes, fruit juice or some sweets, in case your blood sugar level gets low. Artificial sweeteners won't help. You may also need to eat a starchy carbohydrate, like a sandwich or a biscuit, to maintain your blood sugar for longer.,
,If taking in sugar does not help or if the hypo symptoms come back, contact your doctor or the nearest hospital.,
,Make sure your friends and family know about your diabetes and the symptoms of low blood sugar levels so they can recognise a hypo if it happens.,
